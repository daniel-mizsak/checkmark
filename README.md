## Overview
Checkmark is an automated assessment generator and evaluator system.

It works with a predefined question pool and a list of students, and generates quizzes in a format that later can be automatically evaluated by taking a picture of the submission.<br>


## Getting started
<details>
<summary>Motivation</summary>
<br>

Tools that enable automatic quiz evaluation have been around for years.
One example for this is the <a href="https://mateprod.blob.core.windows.net/media/Default/images/Kodlap_Minta.pdf">International Kangaroo Mathematics Contest</a>, which is a multiple-choice test, and the evaluation is done by a computer.

However, these tools require a very specific layout for the submission of the solution.

Unfortunately **Checkmark** is not able solve the general problem and evaluate any kind of submission, but it tries to solve the problem by enabling teachers to generate assessments from their own question pool in an expected layout format.
This makes it possible to evaluate these assessments automatically by scanning the submissions with a mobile phone and thus saving a lot of time for the teachers.
